We appreciate and recognize all the members of the Lunch Money community that have contributed projects.  

If you've built something that you'd like to share with the community please feel free to add it to this collection following these guidelines.


# Contribution Guidelines

**To add, remove, or change the curated list:**, submit a pull request
- follow the [Pull Request template](./PR_TEMPLATE.md) 
- add the reason why the resource is worth being added 

To set this list apart from and complement the official [Lunch Money API](https://lunchmoney.dev) documentation, this repo is a specially curated list for high-quality, actively maintained resources.
- Please contribute links to packages/projects you have used or are familiar with. This will help ensure high-quality entries.
- Add one resource per Pull Request.
- Search existing resources before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Enforce this formatting : * [resource-name](http://link-to-the-resource-repo.com/) - A short description ends with a period.
- Keep descriptions clear, concise, and non-promotional
- Add a section if needed 
   - Add the section description.
   - Add the section title to Table of Contents.
- Don't mention Lunch Money account or API Token in the resource description as it's implied.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Remove any trailing whitespace.

## Quality standards

To be on the list, github repositories should adhere to these quality standards:

- Code functions as documented and expected
- Generally useful to the wider community of Lunch Money users and/or developers
- Actively maintained 
  - Regular, recent commits
  - Or, for finished projects, issues and pull requests are responded to
- Stable or progressing toward stable
- Thoroughly documented (README, comments, samples etc.)
- Tests, where practical


## Reporting issues

Please open an issue if you would like to discuss anything that could be improved or have suggestions for making the list a more valuable resource. 

We realize sometimes projects fall into abandonment or have breaking builds for extended periods of time, so if you see that, feel free to change its listing or let us know. 

We also realize that sometimes projects are just going through transitions or are more experimental in nature. These can still be cool, but we can indicate them as transitory or experimental.

Removal changes not suggested by the projects author will not be applied until they have been pending for a minimum of 1 week (7 days). 

This grace window benefits projects that may be going through a temporary transition but are otherwise worthy of being on the list.


Thanks everyone!
